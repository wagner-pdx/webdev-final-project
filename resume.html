              I am a current graduate student looking for a position where I can
              apply and further develop my new technical abilities. I feel that
              tempering knowledge and skills with industry experience and
              collaborative environments always leads to better outcomes, and a
              more rewarding understanding that has continuously compounding
              benefits. I believe I can provide value to any team I am a part of
              with my years of experience and detail-oriented technical
              expertise.

              I developed new features using JavaScript/CSS/HTML, and SQL
              Databases to expand functionality of the internal .NET web
              application for business. I also lead software testing/validation,
              and user acceptance testing on a major internal feature for
              sending automated email based on a constellation of factors, to
              ensure all functionality present with no defects. I would often
              debug and root-cause existing features throughout the stack to fix
              the internally used business web application. I would frequently
              collaborate with stake holders and users to create requirements
              for features of internal business web application to define scope
              and meet business needs. In addition, I collaborated with
              technical leads to design and review feature implementations to
              meet the requirements of the functional requirements and business
              specification. Sometimes I would write SQL queries to aid in
              business analysis for more efficient and better decision making.
