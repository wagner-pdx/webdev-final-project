<p>
  My name is Andrew Wagner, and I enjoy solving technical problems and puzzles.
  When most often there exists any number of ways to complete a task, I find it
  is most rewarding when the solution is efficient, and the best solution for
  the task. It is for these reasons I have studied Mathematics and Computer
  Science at Portland State University. I have a BS in Mathematics, minor in
  Computer Science, with coursework in areas such as numerical optimization,
  graph theory, and combinatorics. Currently, I am pursuing a MS in Computer
  Science where my focus is in artificial intelligence / machine learning, with
  interest in reinforcement learning. As a hobby, I enjoy games of all types but
  most often video games and tabletop/board games. It is often the case that
  playing games leads me towards projects where I can further hone my technical
  skills as well as pick up new ones. On my page, you will find a selection of
  projects from my coursework and hobbies.
